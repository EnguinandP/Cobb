\section{Introduction}
% Describe the high-level problem you were tackling

Synthesizing test input generators that satisfy a given coverage specification.

Addressing a gap left between type-theoretic but over-approximate synthesis
techniques and

\section{Overview}
% Recap any relevant existing work on this problem, give a high-level
% description of your solution, and summarize the relationship of how your
% solution relates to previous work. Include concrete examples(if applicable),
% that illustrate your solution

\subsection{Property-Based Testing}
A wide range of methods exist to ensure software safety. On the one hand, random testing or fuzzing uses random input to discover, but with the drawback that bugs requiring complex input may not be easily discovered; on the other hand, formal verification provides full safety guarantee, but it requires manual work to prove that the program is safe. 

Property-based testing stands in the middle ground between random testing and formal verification, in that the input generation is guided by the interested property, specified by programmers as logical predicates. This allows the programmers to guide the generated input using the testing predicate, allowing it to discover more intricate bugs, at the same time leveraging automation using SMT solvers to alleviate manual effort.

\subsection{Bottom-Up Synthesis}
We are taking ideas from bottom-up synthesis by starting from the leaf node. Although bottom-up synthesis (citation?) are often inductive and example-based, we use a deductive approach that is based on underapproximate type-checking to ensure correctness of the synthesized program.

\subsection{Deductive synthesis}

\subsection{Coverage Types}

Coverage Types\cite{Poirot}

\subsection{Our Solution}

Coverage + bottom up + test input generators

Deductive synthesis with recursive specifications + bottom up

The intuition behind blocks, covering subsections of the program space. Small
depth programs as contrasted by long traces needed in inductive synthesis.

\section{Implementation}
% Provide key technical details about your solution, e.g. your toplevel
% algorithm, aprecise encoding of your problem in logic, etc.
We have implemented our solution as a bottom-up deductive synthesizer called
Cobb~(https://github.com/Pat-Lafon/Cobb)

Load in various files

Prepare recursive call, structurally decreasing argument with context

Set typechecker global state, initialize starting seeds: constants, variables,
0-arity functions and constructors, and unit generators. Setting up component
abstractions.

Converting seeds to blocks, anormal form and the use of typing contexts to carry
incremental typing state.

Initializing a collection of blocks based on typing. Old and new maps

Incrementing/joining blocks together. Joining contexts/renaming, false coverage
types. Coverage equivalence as a parallel to observational equivalence

Iterating to a fixed depth

Splitting blocks into subtypes versus supertypes, computing joins over the
subtypes.

Choosing the tightest solution

extracting out the final program

\section{Summary of Results}
% Describe how you validated your approach: if you ran experiments to evaluate
% your approach. provide any data or results from those.

\section{Reflection}
% Describe any key design and implementation challenges; how you addressed them
% (what worked, what didn't, and why);and how this work could lead to a real
% tool or a full-length conference paper. What did you learn from doing this project?

Challenges with building on top of the hodge-podge of Poirot's code base.

Finding the right interactions between over and under approximate reasoning. Not
needing overapproximate subtyping to set an upper bounds. Needing blocks with
both over and under approximate types to account for the hybrid typing of arrow
types.

Unlike traditional bottom-up enumeration, you can't look for a solution at every
iteration. The simplest solution is probably the smallest one though that one will
be too general. For example, if you have the generic generator for the target
type, you have a solution to synthesis before you even start. We also need to
limit the number to SMT queries made as they begin to pile up and are expensive.
It seems like this should be easily parallelizable, especially with the release
of Ocaml 5.0 if the type checker has limited mutable state.

The original need for simpler generators arose out of not knowing enough about
the problem space. What actually needed addressing is when to partition the
input space.

Anything else?

\subsection{Possible Typechecker Bugs?}
In our project, the subtyping checks are largely treated as a black box. In the
coarse of using Poirot, we believe we may have ran into some issues that
impacted the correctness of our synthesizer.

\subsubsection{Let binding immediate shadowing}

\subsubsection{Measure issues? The singleton list}

\subsubsection{Structural decreasing constraint on the return type instead of the argument}

\section{Course Topics}
% A one-paragraph description of the course topics applied in the project
This project, through Poirot, makes heavy use of the SMT solver Z3. The
predicates of our type system are embedded in EUFA which is a decidable fragment
of first order logic. The principles of safety specifications and coverage
exploration share parallels with some topics covered like transition system
safety properties and exhaustive state space exploration.

% and a one-paragraph description (if applicable) of any topics that would have
% been useful but weren't covered in the course.
Program synthesis was a planned topic for this course but unfortunately not
covered due to time constraints. In particular, the subtopics of Component-Based
Synthesis and Deductive Synthesis would have been particularly relevant. For
example, covering Synquid or related Haskell synthesis projects. This course
could have gone further in discussing refinement types as a type-theoretic
approach to a decidable fragment of first order logic.

\begin{acks}
    Christopher Nolan for making Inception for whom's main character this tool is
    named after.
    Ashish Mishra who originally purposed the idea of a bottom-up synthesizer
    for coverage types and for allowing Patrick to sit in on his
    under-approximate synthesis meetings and under-approximate reading group.
    Zhe Zhou for the Poirot type checker and showing much patience in answering
    our questions about Poirot's implementation and Coverage Types in general.
